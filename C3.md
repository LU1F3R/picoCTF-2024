## Problem:

This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!Download the ciphertext [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/ciphertext). Download the encoder [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/convert.py). Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}".

## Basic Idea of the problem:

Well, to be honest, this challenge was kind of a tricky one and many people didn’t really like it because of the way it proceeds and some error in the challenge itself. But, in my defence, the error was pretty obvious and well i had fun in this one. So basically you are given a programme that encodes some text in a pretty simple way if you read the programme carefully. 

## Solution:

So this is the encoder used in this programme.

Well the programme is kinda simple, it takes ur input from a file, and for every line, the line is added in the `chars` variable. Then you are given two lists of characters, if i may. And then there is a `out` variable which is declared empty.  a variable `prev`  is also initiated to be 0. 

Then for every character in `chars` , a variable `cur` is defined which is the position of the character in the list. 

Then the `out` variable is added with the index = $(cur - prev) % 40$ % *40 and then the `prev` variable is assigned `cur` ’s value.*

So when i tried to reverse engineer this, i did some hit and trial of my own to see whats going on. I took some random `char` like ‘*hello’*.

and this gives the output as *brHAD.* Good so simply we now need to make a programme that decodes this *brHAD* into ‘hello’. So it wasn’t that difficult to notice things like, we should switch 

`cur = lookup2.index(char)` rather than `cur = lookup1.index(char)`  

`out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]` rather than `out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]` 

Just one catch that took me some time, was to figure out that `prev += cur`  rather than `prev = cur` 

So basically your python script for decoding would look something like this.

When you will run this script your output would be quite shocking tbh. Something like this

Well what do you know, this is a code itself!!

So i saved this in a file named *ciphertext* and then made another file and pasted this output in a file named *output_after_decryption.py.* Now when u will see the python file there is some slight error in the code. It should be `print(char[i])` rather than `print char[i]` . So yeah you gotta make sure to fix that in the python file but leave it as it is in the *ciphertext* file.

Now the issue is…what is the input for this decoder. I tried decrypting the original ciphertext but that didnt work unfortunately. Then after intake of huge amount of caffine, i had this crazy idea of decoding this programme in itself. Doesn’t make sense right? I know. What i mean is, the *ciphertext* file we had, why dont we take that file as the input.

This is the *ciphertext* file that is the input.

so when you run this, you will get the output something like this

which is your flag!!!!

So yeah, fun challenge, a bit of a head-scratcher but i found the concept of using the programme itself as a input quite funny and interesting. 

## Flag:

picoCTF{adlibs}
